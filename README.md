# Amber

A minimalist library for writing Minecraft mini-game plugins in Clojure.

## Introduction

Writing a mini-game for Minecraft often involves storing and handling a lot of data for both players and games. Amber provides a simple and easily extentable set of functions that store such data, and allow you to interact with it easily.

## Why Clojure?

I believe the problem of storing data and accessing it regularly cannot be solved with an object-oriented abstraction, and trying to do so will either lead to performance issues, or an unusable and absurdly complex library. I also really love Clojure and would love to see it more in the Minecraft community!
